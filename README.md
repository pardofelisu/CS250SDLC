   How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   
        I have to interpret user needs from the eyes of the client. Putting myself into the shoes of the client helps me implement features that closely aligns with the clients expectations, and then some. My end goal in implementing these features is to exceed expectations and to think outside of the box. Creating user stories directly aids in this process by simplifying the requirements and the steps it takes to get to the desired end state. Also, user stories can help in outlining which features should be prioritized.
      
     How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    
       When approaching something that needs to be developed, I have to look at the bigger picture. What, exactly is being asked of me, and how should it look? With this, I can usually get a good picture of what the general expectations are and start planning from there. An agile process that I want to incorporate into my future development work is having sprints and daily standups. Sprints allow for me to pace myself properly and can ensure that I am producing something on a regular basis. The daily standups will make sure that I can review myself and my work on a daily basis.
      

     
   What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
   
        A good team member consists of:
        
      - Someone who can openly communicate with their team members.
      
      - Someone who can take criticism and change for the better.
      
      - Someone who works towards a goal that betters themselves and their team.
      
        A team, as a whole, works as a singular entity who needs to deliver a good final product, and being apart of a team like this means that
        you must have integrity and strive for perfection.
